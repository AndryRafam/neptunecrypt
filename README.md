<h2 algin="left"> About </h2>

NeptuneCrypt is a lightweight CLI encryption software using XChaCha20Poly1305, SM4 as cipher for simple encryption and SHA256 as hash key derivation function. 

The software was built with C++ (std=23) and CryptoPP: https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp

- XChaCha20Poly1305: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305
- SM4-GCM (ShāngMì 4): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM4_(cipher) 

<h2 align="left"> Tools and Requierments for building </h2>

- Programming Language: C++ (std=17/20/23)
- Debugger: GNU Debugger, Valgrind
- CryptoPP: Version 8.9.0-2

<h2 align="left"> Building for Linux </h2>

- GNU Make
- GNU C++ Compiler 14.2.0 or compatible

<h2 align="left"> How to encrypt folders ? </h2>

Encrypting file is straightforward. To encrypt folder, first compress/archive the folder (.7z, .zip, .rar, .tar etc.) and then encrypt with NeptuneCrypt.

<h2 align="left"> Future upgrade </h2>

- V1 version + SM4 + AES as single cipher.
