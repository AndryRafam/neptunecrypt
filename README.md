<h2 algin="left"> About </h2>

NeptuneCrypt is a lightweight CLI encryption software using XChaCha20Poly1305, SM4-GCM and Aes-256-GCM (will be added soon) as cipher for simple encryption and SHA256 as hash key derivation function. The software was built with C++ (std=23) and CryptoPP: https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp

<h2 align="left"> About the cipher </h2>

- XChaCha20Poly1305: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305
- SM4-GCM (ShāngMì 4): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM4_(cipher)
- Aes256-GCM (orginal name Rijndael): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard 

<h2 align="left"> Tools and Requierments for building and debugging </h2>

- Programming Language: C++ (std=17/20/23)
- Debugger: GNU Debugger, Valgrind
- CryptoPP: Version 8.9.0-2
- GNU Make
- GNU C++ Compiler 14.2.0 or compatible

<h2 align="left"> Build, install and run on Linux (Debian, Fedora) </h2>
  
To build and install NeptuneCrypt on Linux, go to the directory containing all the codes (for exemple: NeptuneCrypt-main if you downloaded from github repo) and type the following command in terminal (super user mode). The executable file will be installed at /usr/local/bin/ directory.

```bash
$ sudo make install
```
To run NeptuneCrypt on Linux, type the following command anywhere in terminal

```bash
$ neptune
```
<h2 align="left"> How to purge </h2>

To purge NeptuneCrypt, go to the directory containing all the codes (for exemple: NeptuneCrypt-main if you downloaded from github repo) and type the following command in terminal (super user mode).
This command will remove the binary file neptune and all dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo make purge
```

<h2 align="left"> How to encrypt folders ? </h2>

Encrypting file is straightforward. To encrypt folder, first compress/archive the folder (.7z, .zip, .rar, .tar etc.) and then encrypt with NeptuneCrypt.

<h2 align="left"> Future upgrade </h2>

- Adding Aes256-gcm as third cipher.
