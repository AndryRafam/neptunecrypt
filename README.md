<h2 algin="left"> About </h2>

NeptuneCrypt is a lightweight CLI encryption software using XChaCha20Poly1305, SM4-GCM, Aes-256-GCM and Twofish-EAX (aes competition runner up) as cipher for simple encryption and Argon2id for key derivation function (secure password hashing).
The software was built with C++ (std=23) and cryptopp-modern: https://cryptopp-modern.com/

Create and enter a temporary build directory

```json
$ cmake -B build -S .
```
Compile the executable

```bash
$ cmake --build build
```
Install 'neptune' straight to /usr/local/bin

```bash
$ sudo cmake --install build
```
To run on Linux, type the following command anywhere in terminal

```bash
$ neptune
```
<h2 align="left"> Cleaning up </h2>
<h3 align="left"> CMake </h3>

```bash
$ rm -rf build/
```
To purge the installed binary from /usr/local/bin, run:

```bash
$ sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/neptune
```
<h2 align="left"> How to encrypt folders ? </h2>

Encrypting file is straightforward. To encrypt folder, first compress/archive the folder (.7z, .zip, .rar, .tar etc.) and then encrypt.

**NeptuneCrypt is free software and comes with absolutely no warranty.**
